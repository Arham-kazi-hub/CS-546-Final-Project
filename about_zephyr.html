            <h1>About Zephyr Zambrano</h1>
            <p>CWID: 10456780</p>
            <p>I am a graduate student at Stevens Institute of Technology studying Software Engineering. I am scheduled to graduate in December 2020.</p>
            <p>For this project, I worked on the Users collection, the Users routes, some of the front-end Handlebars files, and the embedded Twitter feed on the home page. I also set up the project repository on GitHub and set up the project folder structure.</p>
            <p>In addition, I created and presented the Project Pitch Presentation, and I will be the lead presenter for the Final Project Presentation.</p>
